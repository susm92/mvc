This repository is part of the MVC course at BTH. It demonstrates the MVC pattern using PHP Symfony, which helps keep application logic and user interface separate for easier maintenance and scalability.

For each course module (01â€“06), there is a dedicated page, plus a larger project section. The project is a simple game, where the cards below have been used to impelement a Black Jack game where the user can play multiple hands (1-3).

The badges above show the current code quality, coverage, and build status as reported by Scrutinizer.
